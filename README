web layout is set in the config/site_settings.yml file. It is loaded from an initializer in initializers/site_settings.rb

dynamic module name is set unfortunately in two places:
config/site_settings.yml
config/admin_navigation.yml

Be careful with the admin navigation file, because if it isn't well formed it will break the whole admin.
